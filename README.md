# Software Engineering Thing Yay

A new Flutter project (for now... bwahahaha).

## SE Things

This repository houses the code for the project. Documentation will most likely be Word or G Docs files and will be hosted elsewhere.
	If Word document...
		- Hosted in OneDrive and shared externally with the rest of the team.
	If Google Doc...
		- Hosted in Google Drive (Duh) and then shared externally with the rest of the team.
